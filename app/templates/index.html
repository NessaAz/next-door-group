      It's where communities come together to greet newcomers, exchange
      recommendations, and read the latest local news. Where neighbors support
      local businesses and get updates from public agencies. Where neighbors
      borrow tools and sell couches. It's how to get the most out of everything
      nearby. Welcome, neighbor.
